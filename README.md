# Conc

A concatenative programming language to work as an intermediate representation
for my Virual Machine ([VM in C](https://github.com/louis1001/bytecode_target)).

Inspired by Alexey Kutepov ([Tsoding](https://twitch.tv/tsoding))'s Porth: https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth.
I'm doing this after a few months of watching the making of that language, so I'm trying really
hard not to just copy it directly.

That said, I'm already doing the stack-based typechecking, but that was also inspired by WASM's.

README will be updated as I go along.
